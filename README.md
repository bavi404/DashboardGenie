# Dashboard Genie - Customizable Analytics Dashboards

Building a dynamic analytics dashboard? Don't start from scratch. Leverage our CSS Grid-based templates and visualize your data effortlessly.

**UPDATE: All examples have been upgraded to integrate with [keen-dataviz.js](https://github.com/keen/keen-dataviz.js) and [keen-analysis.js](https://github.com/keen/keen-analysis.js), along with CDN dependencies.** With [keen-dataviz.js](https://github.com/keen/keen-dataviz.js), chart wrappers (`.chart-wrapper`) are auto-rendered, simplifying development.

### Get Started:

Add charts to designated `chart-stage` elements in your HTML:

```html
<div class="grid-hero">
  <div class="hero chart-wrapper">
    <div class="chart-title">
      Chart Title
    </div>
    <div class="chart-stage">
      <div id="grid-1-1">
        <!-- chart goes here! -->
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="chart-notes">
      Additional notes (optional)
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Voil√†! A polished, responsive analytics dashboard, ready for presentation.
